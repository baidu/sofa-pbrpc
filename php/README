This directory contains the php extension for sofa-pbrpc client.

Installation
============

1) Make sure your PHP version is at least 5.4 and you have installed sofa-pbrpc library in sofa-pbrpc output

   You should install the allegro/php-protobuf and use this lib in your PHP codes and you can get

   "allegro/php-protobuf" on this page:

    https://github.com/allegro/php-protobuf

3) Change the dependences path:

    Change the dependences path "RPCLIB_DIR" and "PROTOBUFLIB_DIR" in comfig.m4

4) Build the extension

    Run "/usr/local/php/bin/phpize ./config.m4"

        "./configure --with-php-config=/usr/local/php/bin/php-config" to generate Makefile

    Run "make clean && make -j10 && make install" to build the extension

    You can get extension in ./modules

5) Generate PHP interface

    You can generate PHP interface like this:

        "php -c /usr/etc/php.ini protoc-php.php test.proto"
